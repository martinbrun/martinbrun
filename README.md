Hi!

My name is Martin Brun.

I am an Economist (PhD at Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, BSc at Universidad de la República). Currently I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Finnish Centre of Excellence in Tax Systems Research (FIT) at Tampere University.

I am interested in Behavioral Economics, with a particular focus on social preferences and bounded rationality.
